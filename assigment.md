Implement a simple chatbot that will assist users in selling cars.

Requirements:
-/ The chatbot should be proactive, meaning it should drive the conversation.
-/ Memory should be used (as simple as possible).
-/ Avoid using frameworks; use direct REST communication (depending on the LLM provider).
Examples of user queries:
“I want to buy a car for my wife.”
“What will be the best gift for the New Year?”
!Important:
-/ You can use any tech stack; we are focusing on GenAI knowledge, not on a particular language.
-/ This task is very simple, please do not overcomplicate it.
-/ You can use any free LLM provider; for example, OpenRouter provides free access to models, or Google Gemini.
